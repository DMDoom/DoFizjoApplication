FantasyTM is a web application written in Java using the Spring Framework created in effort to drive popularity and audience engagement with e-sport tournaments of a popular video game Trackmania.
FantasyTM allows game fans to assemble a virtual and imaginary team composed of proxies of real players of professional trackmania. These virtual teams then compete against each other based on statistical performance of the real players in actual Trackmania games.
That performance is then converted into points and totalled. The team with most points and the best scoring fantasy roster wins. In addition to that, FantasyTM also allows for applying temporary buffs to players; e.g. if a team owner is confident that a certain player will perform well on a given map, they can triple the amount of points they will earn this week.
Unfortunately, due to recently changed game format, FantasyTM is unlikely to go live anytime soon.
